# Personal Information Manager (OO Perl)

This is a web application written in object oriented Perl with the primary intention to act as a knowledge base. I used it intensely for almost 10 years and it grew so that it had a the end several modules: 

* Knowledge base
* Synchronization with local computer
* Email client
* Mind map drawing tool
* Accounting
* Investment portfolio calculator
* Vocabulary trainer
* Calendar (similar to Outlook calendar)

The Perl code was designed almost like a library so that new pages could be created easily. There are templates for pages and grid layouts and to display tables. 
 
The application makes use of Ajax. All JavaScript code is programmed from scratch, no frameworks were used. I wanted to learn to program object oriented Perl and create own object oriented JavaScript components.
